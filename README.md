Based on cities (nodes), edges (roads) and weights (road altitudes) finds the path from start (1) to destination
by finding the path which is minimizing the maximum altitude of roads. 

Solution is based on creating Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree and using that to deliver the best path with Dijkstras algorithm.
